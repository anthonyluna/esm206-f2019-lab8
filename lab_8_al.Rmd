### 1. One-way ANOVA to compare penguin flipper lengths

![](penguin-heights.jpg)

Read in the data, get some counts, etc:

```{r}
penguins <- readr::read_csv("penguins.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()
```

Find some counts based on specices and sex

```{r}
penguin_count <- penguins %>% 
  count(species, sex)

penguin_count
```

Is there a significant difference in mean flipper length for female penguins across the 3 species?


Create a subset tht only contains obs. for female penguins, then cisually explore the distributuion for each species:

```{r}
# Create subset with only female penguins

penguin_f <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "FEMALE")

# Visually explore the distribution of flipper lengths for the three species:

# histograms:

ggplot(data = penguin_f, aes(x=flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~species)


ggplot(data = penguin_f, aes(sample = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_qq()+
  facet_wrap(~species*study_name)

# Look close to normally distributed, all groups have n>30 => use parametric
# one-way ANOVA to compare flipper lengths


```

Find some summary statistics using group_by + summarize:

```{r}
penguin_f_summary <-  penguin_f %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
    sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm),
    sample_size = n(),
    se_flipper = sd(flipper_length_mm)/sqrt(n()),
    var_flipper_length = var(flipper_length_mm)
    )
    
penguin_f_summary
```

Levene's test:

```{r}
leveneTest(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data=penguin_f)

# Results indicate to retain the null hypothesis (variances are equal across groups)
```

Beeswarm plot with the mean and the standard deviation overlayed:

```{r}

ggplot()+
  geom_beeswarm(data = penguin_f,
                aes(x = species,y=flipper_length_mm),
                size= 3,
                alpha = 0.6,
                pch = 16,
                color = "grey70") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo")) +
  geom_point(data = penguin_f_summary, aes(x=species, y=mean_flipper_length),
             color = "red")+
  geom_errorbar(data = penguin_f_summary, aes(x=species,
                                              ymin=mean_flipper_length - sd_flipper_length,
                                              ymax=mean_flipper_length + sd_flipper_length), 
                color = "red", 
                width = .2, 
                size = 1)+
  theme_light()
```

**Figure 1.** Flipper lengths (mm) for adelie (n=), chinstrap (n=), and Gentoo (n=) penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica. Means indicated by black points; error bars indicatd $\pm$ 1 standard deviation. Data Source: {}

```{r}
penguin_aov <- aov(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_f)

penguin_aov
summary(penguin_aov)

# There Is a significant difference in mean flipper lengths between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins at Palmer Station (F(2, 162) = 411.8 p < 0.0001)
```

... Well if the means aren't equal, then which ones differ?

```{r}
TukeyHSD(penguin_aov)
```

One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD reveals a significant difference in mean female flipper length between all 3 species (Gentoo, Adelie, Chinstrap) (stats results...)


### Part 2: Tables, and Proportions and chi-square

```{r}
party_relig <-  gss_cat %>% 
  filter(partyid %in% c("Strong republican", "Strong democrat")) %>% 
  filter(relig %in% c("None","Catholic")) %>% 
  count(partyid, relig)

party_relig_contable <- party_relig %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = relig, values_from = n) 

```

Make a nice table of counts and proportions within each group:

```{r}
party_relig_prop <-  party_relig_contable %>% 
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% 
  janitor::adorn_ns(position="front")

kable(party_relig_prop) %>% 
  kable_styling()

```

Chi-Squared testing is all about checking the shift in proportions based on a factor. Now we are going to run a chi-square test for independence. First, get only a contingency table (values only; noadditional columns)

```{r}
chi_counts <- party_relig_contable %>% 
  select(-partyid)
chi_counts

```


A couple of questions to prompt a chi-square:

 * Is there a significant difference in religious affiliation (non/catholic) between strong democrats and strong republicans?
 * is there a significant association between party affiliation (strong dem/ strong republican) on religious afiliation (none/Catholic).
 
```{r}
chi_test <- chisq.test(chi_counts)

chi_test
```
 
H~0~: No significant association between categories (political affiliation and religious affiliation are independent)

 - There is a significant association between partyid and religious affiliation ($\chi^2$ = ).
 - Religious affiliation (none/Catholic) differed significantly between strong democrats and strong republicans.
 - The proportions of people who identify as atheist or catholic differs significantly for strong republicans or strong democrats.
